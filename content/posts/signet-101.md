## Quick introduction to bitcoin signet

Bitcoin signet is a new test network that can be built & run by anyone. Think of it as a way to run a copy of bitcoin easily, that is not testnet.

As developers in the bitcoin ecosystem, we often need to test our software & integrations under a variety of conditions. Traditionally developers have always relied on testnet but over time testnet has gotten harder to replicate issues predictably and often behaves drastically different compared to mainnet. Some commonly experienced issues on testnet include hoarding testnet coins, no incentive to regularly mine and therefore no predictable block schedule leading to <a href = "https://blog.lopp.net/the-block-storms-of-bitcoins-testnet/" target="_blank">Block Storms</a>, inability to trigger specific conditions at will, etc.

On the other hand, regtest offers a perfect, sanitized, programmable environment to perform software testing, but is limited to an individual developers workflow and they may not be able to co-ordinate a network level test if needed.

Thus, bitcoin signet was born and is different from bitcoin mainnet & testnet in only one additional requirement: valid blocks contain the signature of the network operator.

## Why we are excited about bitcoin signet

We are excited for bitcoin signet for two reasons:

1. It offers an incredible teaching tool, by enabling the student to get hands on and learn the technical underpinnings of the bitcoin ecosystem.

2. Contribute to open source by finding and reporting issues in software. As developers, another nuance we understand is that building software requires testing, validation and often done purposefully and intentionally. This is a huge gap in open source software that we wish to bridge, make a difference and build a working & productive relationship with the developers in the space.
